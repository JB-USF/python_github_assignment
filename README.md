Average Daily Study Time and Test Score Increase 

    My python project takes an input of total hours studied, original test score, and new test scores. It does this to show the user how many hours they studied on average per day and how much their test score went up by each hour of studying.

    To run use python app.py

    An example output is 
    Average daily study hours: 1.7142857142857142
    Score change per hour studied: 3.3333333333333335.

    That output used these inputs to produce it 
    Enter total hours studied this week: 12
    Enter first test score: 50
    Enter second test score: 90.
